# s2-lite

This is the home of `s2-lite` — an open source, self-hostable implementation of the [S2 API](https://s2.dev/docs/rest) for durable streams.

_It will be backed by [SlateDB](https://slatedb.io), and it is currently in development._

Check out [s2.dev](https://s2.dev/) for the serverless cloud offering.
